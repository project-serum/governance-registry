/// # Introduction
///
/// The governance registry is an "addin" to the SPL governance program that
/// allows one to both vote with many different ypes of tokens for voting and to
/// scale voting power as a linear function of time locked--subject to some
/// maximum upper bound.
///
/// The flow for voting with this program is as follows:
///
/// - Create a SPL governance realm.
/// - Create a governance registry account.
/// - Add exchange rates for any tokens one wants to deposit. For example,
///   if one wants to vote with tokens A and B, where token B has twice the
///   voting power of token A, then the exchange rate of B would be 2 and the
///   exchange rate of A would be 1.
/// - Create a voter account.
/// - Deposit tokens into this program, with an optional lockup period.
/// - Vote.
///
/// Upon voting with SPL governance, a client is expected to call
/// `decay_voting_power` to get an up to date measurement of a given `Voter`'s
/// voting power for the given slot. If this is not done, then the transaction
/// will fail (since the SPL governance program will require the measurement
/// to be active for the current slot).
///
/// # Interacting with SPL Governance
///
/// This program does not directly interact with SPL governance via CPI.
/// Instead, it simply writes a `VoterWeightRecord` account with a well defined
/// format, which is then used by SPL governance as the voting power measurement
/// for a given user.
///
/// # Max Vote Weight
///
/// Given that one can use multiple tokens to vote, the max vote weight needs
/// to be a function of the total supply of all tokens, converted into a common
/// currency. For example, if you have Token A and Token B, where 1 Token B =
/// 10 Token A, then the `max_vote_weight` should be `supply(A) + supply(B)*10`
/// where both are converted into common decimals. Then, when calculating the
/// weight of an individual voter, one can convert B into A via the given
/// exchange rate, which must be fixed.
///
/// Note that the above also implies that the `max_vote_weight` must fit into
/// a u64.
