# Description

Voter-stake-registry is a voter weight addin for Solana's
[spl-governance program](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/governance).

With the addin enabled, the governance realm authority can:

- Control which token mints can be used to vote, and at what scaling factor.

  That means that tokens from mints other than the governing mint can be used
  to vote and that their relative weight can be set.

- Claw back locked tokens from user deposits where the user has enabled it.

  This is intended for use with token grants. Users would not enable clawback
  for normal deposits.

Users can:

- Deposit and withdraw tokens of the chosen mints to gain voting weight.

  When an addin is enabled, the default deposit/withdraw flow of the governing
  token mints is disabled in spl-governance. The addin adds back the ability
  to deposit and withdraw without lockup.

- Lock up tokens with different vesting schedules.

  The tokens will only be withdrawable once vested or the lock up has expired.
  Locked up tokens may have extra voting weight.

- Use their voting weight to vote on spl-governance proposals.


# Usage Scenarios

## Setup

To start using the addin, make a governance proposal with the spl-governance
realm authority to:
1. Deploy an instance of the voter-stake-registry.
2. Create a registrar for the realm with the `CreateRegistrar` instruction.
3. Add voting token mints to the registrar by calling the `ConfigureVotingMint`
   instruction as often as desired.
4. Call the `SetRealmConfig` instruction on spl-governance to set the
   voter-weight-addin program id and thereby enable the addin.

## Deposit and Vote Without Lockup

1. Call `CreateVoter` on the addin (first time only). Use the same
   voter_authority that was used for registering with spl-governance.
2. Call `CreateDepositEntry` for the voter with `LockupKind::None`
   and the token mint for that tokens are to be deposited. (first time only)

   This creates a new deposit entry that can be used for depositing and
   withdrawing funds without lockup.
3. Call `Deposit` for the voter and same deposit entry id to deposit funds.
4. To vote, call `UpdateVoterWeightRecord` on the addin and then call `CastVote`
   on spl-governance in the same transaction, passing the voter weight record
   to both.
5. Withdraw funds with `Withdraw` once proposals have resolved.

## Give Grants of Locked Tokens

1. Ask the recepient to `CreateVoter` and `CreateDepositEntry` with the desired
   lock up period, vesting and `allow_clawback=true`. Double check the address
   and deposit entry id they communicate.
2. Make a proposal to call `Deposit` for depositing tokens into their locked
   deposit entry.
3. If necessary, later make a proposal to call `Clawback` on their deposit to
   retrieve all remaining locked tokens.

# Instruction Overview

## Setup

- [`CreateRegistrar`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/create_registrar.rs)

  Creates a Registrar account for a governance realm.

- [`ConfigureVotingMint`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/configure_voting_mint.rs)

  Enables voting with tokens from a mint and sets the exchange rate for vote weight.

## Usage

- [`CreateVoter`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/create_voter.rs)

  Create a new voter account for a user.

- [`CreateDepositEntry`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/create_deposit_entry.rs)

  Create a deposit entry on a voter. A deposit entry is where tokens from a voting mint
  are deposited, and which may optionally have a lockup period and vesting schedule.

  Each voter can have multiple deposit entries.

- [`Deposit`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/deposit.rs)

  Add tokens to a deposit entry.

- [`Withdraw`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/withdraw.rs)

  Remove tokens from a deposit entry, either unlocked or vested.

- [`ResetLockup`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/reset_lockup.rs)

  Re-lock tokens where the lockup has expired, or increase the duration of the lockup.

- [`UpdateVoterWeightRecord`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/update_voter_weight_record.rs)

  Write the current voter weight to the account that spl-governance can read to
  prepare for voting.

- [`CloseDepositEntry`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/close_deposit_entry.rs)

  Close an empty deposit entry, so it can be reused for a different mint or lockup type.

- [`CloseVoter`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/close_deposit_entry.rs)

  Close an empty voter, reclaiming rent.

## Special

- [`Clawback`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/close_deposit_entry.rs)

  As the clawback authority, claim locked tokens from a voter's deposit entry that
  has opted-in to clawback.

- [`UpdateMaxVoteWeight`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/update_max_vote_weight.rs)

  Unfinished instruction for telling spl-governance about the total maximum vote weight.

- [`SetTimeOffset`](programs/voter-stake-registry/src/instructions/set_time_offset.rs)

  Debug instruction for advancing time in tests. Not usable.
